# one-pager
template for creating one page site for modern web

## goal
Test out modern web elements to create very fast one page site using only web API and polyfills. 

## how it works
Page will be divided to sub-pages. First page is loaded initially along with app code that loads rest of the sub pages.
Everything is built up using web components and ES6 standards. Site supports offline mode and web app.

* [ ] setup page navigation
* [ ] setup dynamic page loading (load landing sync, but sub pages async to get fast first paint)
